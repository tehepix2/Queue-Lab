# Queue-Lab

Write a program to represent four ticket windows at a movie theater.  As customers arrive, they join the smallest queue, using an enqueue operation.  Randomly determine when customers arrive, and how long they take at the ticket window. .  When the ticket seller is ready for another customer, that customer object is removed from the front of the queue using a dequeue operation.  Print a message each time an operation occurs during the simulation.  Show which queue has the shortest waiting time.
